                    <div id="section1-body">
                        <p>Non-Fungible Yearn is a DeFi platform whose goal is to utilize the full potential of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) in the DeFi sector.
                            As of now, DeFi is dominated by <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20">ERC-20</a> tokens, which are fungible tokens, meaning that all are the same and are no unique from one another.
                            While ERC-20 tokens are surely needed and are not going to be going away anytime soon, there are many other different <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/erc">token standards</a> that are rarely mentioned,
                            ERC-721 being one of them. ERC-721 tokens are non-fungible tokens, meaning that each token is unique and no two are like, this is because of the unique token id that each token is given at the time
                            of being minted. Currently, ERC-721 tokens are mostly used as collectibles, the Non-Fungible Yearn platform will re-imagine how these tokens have been used by creating a use case for them in DeFi.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div id="section2">
                    <h2 id="section2-title">Staking</h2>
                    <div id="section2-body">
                        <p>The platform will allow a user to stake their various cryptocurrency holdings in multiple different pools to earn NFY, the governance token of the platform.
                            Traditionally, DeFi staking platforms allow a user to earn yield based on the staked amount in their wallet. The NFY platform will create an ecosystem where instead of
                            a wallet address being linked to a stake, a NFT will be the rights to those staked funds and the yield that it bares. The staking process will be the same as any other staking platform. The key difference is that
                            when a user stakes on the NFY platform a NFT will be minted and by referencing the unique token id the details of the user's stake will be stored in the NFT by referencing its unique token id. The user is
                            also given the option to choose if they want their rewards to be added to their NFT and allow the NFT to go up in value,
                            or if the user wants their rewards to be redeemable. The current holder of the NFT will also be able to change this any time they choose. While this may seem like
                            a ridiculous use case, there are many positives that will come out of the process.
                        </p>

                        <p>Constantly staking and unstaking are costly transactions for not only the user, but also the Ethereum blockchain. The current maximum block size for Ethereum is around 1,500,000 gas. With Ethereum doing billions of
                            dollars in volume each day there is a gas race for people to get their transactions in to each block. This causes a bottleneck of people trying to get their transactions to be picked up by a miner. The effect of this? Higher
                            transaction fees and slow confirmation times. Plenty of this traffic is coming from users staking nad unstaking on various DeFi platforms. With NFY there is no more need to unstake your tokens if you want to stop staking, just
                            simply sell the NFY!
                        </p>

                        <p>Instead of unstaking their tokens, when a user is done with the protocol or just simply wants to get rid of their tokens they are staking, they can just go to the market and sell their NFT. Since all of the
                            details will be stored in the specific token, they will be able to sell their NFT at the market value. All interest accrued will be redeemable by the user that was holding the NFT. No expensive transaction on the user to unstake
                            and no extra congestion in the network! Even if a user does not want to sell all of their stake they can simply put a portion of that on the market and keep the rest, the value of the NFT will simply be updated and
                            a new one will be minted to the buyer.

                        </p>  
                        <p>
                             If a user wants to they can always unstake, again this process will be the same as they are used to. In this unstaking process though the desired NFT is burned and staked funds plus unredeemed rewards will be transferred to the user.
                        A fee of 5% will be taken out of the value of the NFT to redistribute to the protocol to create a self-sustaining system and to encourage trading of the NFT. Easy and clean!

                    <h2 id="section3-title">Liquidity Locking</h2>
                    <div id="section3-body">
                        <p>
                        Locking your liquidity may seem like a scary move, but with NFY it does not have to be! Once a user stakes their NFY/ETH liquidity token in the NFY platform it will be locked in the platform forever, but while the LP tokens
                        are locked in the staking contract, the value is not. This is done by minting a NFT at the time of staking that will wrap the value you have locked in a transferable ERC-721 token.
                        Everything about the stake will be stored in the data that is unique to each token. Why be locked in to providing liquidity forever? If you realize you no longer want to be a liquidity provider you can go on the market and
                        trade that NFT for the market value of the liquidity tokens and the accrued rewards! Now some of you whales out there may be worried that your massive stake will never get filled on the market, but do not worry.
                        All the rights to that value may start off wrapped in a single NFT, but this can easily be broken down into smaller portions simply by minting another NFT and delegating the value you desire to it!

                        When the NFY token contract is deployed, 60,000 NFY will be locked as reward tokens. These tokens will be locked for 14 days once token sale is started, this will give NFY enough
                        time to properly finish and properly tests staking vaults. There will be 2 staking vaults that will be deployed to start, NFY staking vault and NFY/ETH liquidity pool token
                        vault. 0.30% of the rewards from the reward vault will be sent every 24 hours and will be distributed between each pool.

                        <p>
                            This means that on the first day staking pools are launched, 60,000 x 0.30% = 180 NFY will be distributed out of reward vault. Then on the second day:
                        (60,000 - 180) X 0.030% = 179.46 NFYB.

                        The potential of NFTs and the ERC-721 standard in DeFi are endless! NFYB's goal is to be a pioneer and be one of the first to have this potential be seen by the masses.
                        The crypto-sphere moves fast, before anyone knows it NFTs will be implemented in every new DeFi project. The NFT boom is still yet to come, but it is coming!
                        Crypto as we know it may be in for another huge change, we saw the ERC-20 boom in 2017, we will see a ERC-721 boom in the near future. The only question is:
                        Will you be on board?

                            Non-Fungible Yearn is a new experiment in DeFi. Just like any new experiment, risk is involved. Please do not invest more than you have to lose.

                            As rewards from reward vault are distributed, rewards will be replenished out of the 1% transaction fee from each NFT transfer. Please realize that
                            these rewards are based on the transfer volume of these NFTs and the reward vault will run out if there in no volume in the platform.
